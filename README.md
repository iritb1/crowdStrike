- Generates a styled HTML file with:
  - A table listing each collateral adjective and its associated animals
  - Clickable animal names that link to their downloaded images
- Uses multi-threading for efficient image downloading
- Includes unit tests to ensure reliability

How It Works-
  Scraper (scraper.py)
  - Fetches the Wikipedia page containing animal names
  - Extracts collateral adjectives (e.g., "canine" â†’ "Dog")
  - Uses regex filtering to clean the extracted text
  - Finds animal links and sends them for image downloading

  Image Downloader (downloader.py)-
  - Extracts the first image from each animal's Wikipedia page
  - Handles missing images gracefully (logs a warning)
  - Stores images in the /tmp/ folder

  HTML Generator (html_generator.py)-
  - Formats the extracted data into a styled HTML table
  - Creates links to the downloaded images
  - Ensures the output is clean and readable
