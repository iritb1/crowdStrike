How It Works-
Scraper (scraper.py)- 1. Fetches the Wikipedia page containing animal names 2. Extracts collateral adjectives (e.g., "canine" â†’ "Dog") 3. Uses regex filtering to clean the extracted text 4. Finds animal links and sends them for image downloading

    Image Downloader (downloader.py)-
        1. Extracts the first image from each animal's Wikipedia page
        2. Handles missing images gracefully (logs a warning)
        3. Stores images in the /tmp/ folder

    HTML Generator (html_generator.py)-
        1. Formats the extracted data into a styled HTML table
        2. Creates links to the downloaded images
        3. Ensures the output is clean and readable
